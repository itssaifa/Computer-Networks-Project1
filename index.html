    <h1>Website Setup & Networking Report</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Domain & Hosting</h2>
        <p>For hosting and domain setup, GitHub Pages was used. It provides a free and simple way to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. By pushing the project files to a public repository and enabling GitHub Pages, the website was deployed with a free subdomain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Website Setup</h2>
        <p>The website was built using a combination of HTML and CSS to ensure a clean and neat layout. No JavaScript or other frameworks were used, keeping the site lightweight and easy to maintain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Networking Aspects</h2>
        <p>The site is publicly accessible online through GitHub Pages. GitHub handles a lot of the networking configuration, including setting up DNS records and generating an IP address for the hosted site. This demonstrates key networking principles such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> GitHub Pages assigns a unique subdomain under github.io, translating URLs to IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> The hosted website is served from GitHub's IP range, making it reachable worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> The site is accessible via HTTPS, ensuring secure communication between users and the server.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p><strong>Website Link:</strong> <a href="https://adnan423.github.io/Computer-Networks-Project1/" target="_blank">https://adnan423.github.io/Computer-Networks-Project1/</a></p>
        <p><strong>Setup Process:</strong> The site was built using HTML and CSS, then pushed to a GitHub repository. GitHub Pages was enabled to deploy the website.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> One challenge was ensuring that all of the file paths worked correctly, because GitHub Pages won't work without perfdect structuring. Also, configuring a custom domain requires proper DNS settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Networking Principles Applied:</strong> The site demonstrates DNS resolution, IP addressing, and HTTPS protocol handling through GitHub Pages infrastructure.</p>
